About
 This repository contains the source code for a personal "About Me" web page. It's designed to provide a brief overview of my skills, interests, and contact information. The primary goal was to create a straightforward and visually appealing introduction using fundamental web technologies.


Features
 -Clean Design: A minimalist and easy-to-read layout.
 -Responsive: Adapts reasonably well to different screen sizes (though not explicitly designed for mobile responsiveness, the basic CSS allows for good readability).
 -Highlighting: Key information like name, specialization, and contact is highlighted for quick recognition.
 -Simple Structure: Easy to understand and modify due to its direct HTML and CSS implementation.


Technologies Used
 -HTML5: For the page structure and content.
 -CSS3: For styling and layout.
